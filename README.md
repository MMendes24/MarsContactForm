# Decision Form for MK

Form should be entirely functional and send emails to whatever email you input. It uses the name field as the subject and sets the body of the email to the message that you enter. Each time send is hit on a valid form, it posts the info to DynamoDB before dispatching the email. It is a serverless react-app styled entirely with Material-UI.
