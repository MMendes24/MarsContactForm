# Decision Form for MK

Form should be entirely functional and send emails to any SES verified email address. It uses the name field as the subject and sets the body of the email to message. Each time send is hit on a valid form, it posts the info to a DynanoDB before dispatching the email. It is a serverless react-app styled entirely with Material-UI. It was certainly challenging as I have never used AWS before but it was a lot of fun to make.
